# Install Webpack and Webpack CLI as development dependencies
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

code package.json

npm install

# Once your dependencies are installed and Webpack is configured, 
# you can run the build command to generate the production-ready bundle:
npm run build
# This will typically create a dist folder with optimized files for deployment.
